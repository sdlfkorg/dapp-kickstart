# dapp-kickstart

The dapp is a kickstarter-like project.

The user can deploy smart contract on ethereum Rinkeby test network and let other user to create campaign (like each funding project of kickstarter) for crowdfunding. 

After the user created a campaign, the other users can choose to support the campaign. 

The campaign raiser can make requests to buy something for finishing the campaigns, and the campaign supporters can decide whether to approve the request.
